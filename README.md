The "Research paper (Relevant)" includes the papers that illustrate the pure star-burst line and maximum star-burst line, and give the expressions of calculation of electron density and dust extinction.  

For the important BPT diagrams, FWHM, and velocity diagrams, they are located in the parameter information folder under the Research_Line_Fitting folder. 

For the output of raw data, they are all in the Output folder. Each subfolder correspond to one spectrum of the given name. 

The raw data (fits files) is in the folder of "Research_Line_Fitting/OHMG-IRAS11506-longslit-spectra".
